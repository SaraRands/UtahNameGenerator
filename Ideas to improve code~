Utah Name Generator project

Separate programs: one to generate spinner, another to input spinner and generate names
Make the project into a GUI
Make the project able to be sent to others
Make the project into an applet and put on my personal website
Experiment with other training data: 2013 US names, other states (?), Utah names from the Utah Baby Namer website
Update when the 2014 Social Security data comes out
Experiment with 3-grams, 2-grams, 5-grams?
