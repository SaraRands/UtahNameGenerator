# UtahNameGenerator
Generates a unique Utah name, using 2000-2014 Social Security Name data for Utah and a four-gram language model


Utah has a justified reputation for naming their babies unique and innovative names. This program takes in all of the names given to five or more Utah babies per year for 2000 - 2014, according to the [Social Security data](http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html), converts the data into a [four-gram language model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram), and uses that data to generate a new Utah name. If the name generated is the same as an existing name in the database, the name is rejected and another name is generated, to guarantee a unique name.

## How to Run the Utah Name Generator
Download the folder and run the batch file at the command line by navigating to the downloaded folder and typing

```
UtahNameGenerator.bat
```

The program will output a unique girl and boy Utah name, different from all other Utah names in the Social Security Database but with the same distinctive Utah style.

### More about the Program
The four-gram language model is in the file called Utah2000-2014Spinner.txt. This is a comma separated file of four-grams and the logarithm of their associated probabilities. The three start characters (i.e.  characters start - 3, start - 2, and start - 1) are represented by ^_` [carat, underscore, accent], and the three end characters are {|} [open curly bracket, pipe, close curly bracket].
